| Pattern     | Details                                                           | Comments                                                                               |

## Notes

- Design Pattern
  - It is not a solution
  - It is a guide to a solution
  - A blueprint, can be adpated to the specific problem being handled
- Pattern
  - A Pattern is considered as a high level description of a solution
  - The pattern does not provide a specific set of code
    - Rather it is a conceptual idea
      - That we use to solve a particular type of problem
- Why use Pattern
  - Idea behind using a pattern is *not just solving a problem*
  - It is also about *being efficient*
  - Software solutions that can be appplied to common software problems
    - E.g, common software problems
      - Logging in
      - Developping a shopping cart
      - Creating an online payment module
  - These all have been created before
    - And in these patterns exists in all of these different situations
  - Advantages
    - Communicate between developers
      - More efficiently and more effectively
    - More productive
- Importance of Design Patterns
