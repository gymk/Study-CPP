# Standard Template Library

## C++ Objects, Containers and Maps

- _Objects_: a way to make parts of the program more self-contained, tying together data and behaviour. Objects can be related to other objects.
- _Containers_: ways of clumping together variables of the same type so that sorting, searching, etc., becomes easy
- _Maps_: ways of setting up a mapping between 2 set of values

# Container

A container is an object which is used to store other objects and taking care of management of the memory used by the objects it contains.

Three types of containers supported by STL
1. Container Adapter
2. Sequence Container
3. Associate Container

## Sequence Container

- vector
- deque
- array
- list
- forward_list

A sequence container is a container that stores objects of the same type in a linear arrangement.

Sequence containers are usually implemented as arrays or linked-lists.

## Associative Container

- Ordeered
    - set
    - multiset
    - map
    - multimap
- Unordered
    - unordered_set
    - unordered_multiset
    - unordered_map
    - unordered_multimap

Ordered Associative containers are usually implemented as 
binary trees
Unordered Associate Containers are usually implemented as hash tables
